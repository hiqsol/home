I use no special tool to setup home, only a package manager.

The whole home is comprised of the root package (holding private data)
and dependencies like this:

- hiqsol/home - private root package
    - hiqsol/dotfiles - this package
    - [hiqsol/quotes]

I use [composer] package manager to setup dependencies.

Other tools I use:

- [hidev] to create and maintain packages
- [rewatcher] to watch changes in repos

[hidev]:            https://github.com/hiqdev/hidev
[rewatcher]:        https://github.com/hiqdev/rewatcher
[composer]:         https://getcomposer.org/
[hiqsol/quotes]:    https://github.com/hiqsol/quotes
