        I use [rehome] to setup and maintain my home:

        ```sh
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiqdev/rehome/master/rehome; python rehome init hiqsol/dotfiles
        ```

        Other tools I use:

        - [hidev] to create and maintain packages
        - [rewatcher] to watch changes in repos

        [hidev]:        https://github.com/hiqdev/hidev
        [rehome]:       https://github.com/hiqdev/rehome
        [rewatcher]:    https://github.com/hiqdev/rewatcher

plugins:
    hiqsol/hidev-hiqsol: "<2.0 || dev-master"
