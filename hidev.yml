package:
    type:           project
    name:           dotfiles
    title:          Sol's dotfiles
    keywords:       sol, home, dotfiles

        I use no special tool to setup home, only a package manager.

        The whole home is comprised of the root package (holding private data)
        and dependencies like this:

            - hiqsol/home - private root package
                - hiqsol/dotfiles - this package
                - hiqsol/quotes

        I use [composer] package manager to setup dependencies.

        Other tools I use:

        - [hidev] to create and maintain packages
        - [rewatcher] to watch changes in repos

        [hidev]:        https://github.com/hiqdev/hidev
        [rewatcher]:    https://github.com/hiqdev/rewatcher
        [composer]:     https://getcomposer.org/
